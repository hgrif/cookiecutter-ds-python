This paper describes the use of the \LaTeXe\
\textsf{\journalclass} class file for setting papers to be
submitted to \textit{Transportation Research Record}.
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

%\section{Introduction}
\noindent Many authors submitting to research journals use \LaTeXe\ to
prepare their papers. This paper describes the
\textsf{\journalclass} class file which can be used to convert
articles produced with other \LaTeXe\ class files into the correct
form for submission to \textit{Transportation Research Record}.

The \textsf{\journalclass} class file preserves much of the
standard \LaTeXe\ interface so that any document which was
produced using the standard \LaTeXe\ \textsf{article} style can
easily be converted to work with the \textsf{\journalclassshort}
style. However, the width of text and typesize will vary from that
of \textsf{article.cls}; therefore, \textit{line breaks will change}
and it is likely that displayed mathematics and tabular material
will need re-setting.

In the following sections we describe how to lay out your code to
use \textsf{\journalclass} to reproduce much of the typographical look of
\textit{Transportation Research Record}. However, this paper is not a guide to
using \LaTeXe\ and we would refer you to any of the many books
available (see, for example, \cite{R1,R2,R3}).

\section{The Three Golden Rules}
Before we proceed, we would like to stress \textit{three golden
rules} that need to be followed to enable the most efficient use
of your code at the typesetting stage:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] keep your own macros to an absolute minimum;

\item[(ii)] as \TeX\ is designed to make sensible spacing
decisions by itself, do \textit{not} use explicit horizontal or
vertical spacing commands, except in a few accepted (mostly
mathematical) situations, such as \verb"\," before a
differential~d, or \verb"\quad" to separate an equation from its
qualifier;

\item[(iii)] follow the journal reference style (a \textsf{\journalclassshort} bst file is available).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Getting Started} The \textsf{\journalclassshort} class file should run
on any standard \LaTeXe\ installation. If any of the fonts, style
files or packages it requires are missing from your installation,
they can be found on the \textit{\TeX\ Collection} DVDs or downloaded from
CTAN.

\section{The Article Header Information}
The heading for any file using \textsf{\journalclass} is shown in
Figure~\ref{F1}.  \textit{Transportation Research Record} is published using Times fonts and this is
achieved by using the \verb"times"
option as\\
\verb"\documentclass[times]{TRR}"

\noindent If for any reason you have a problem using Times you can
easily resort to Computer Modern fonts by removing the
\verb"times" option.

\subsection{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] In \verb"\runninghead" use `{et~al}' if there
are three or more authors.

\item[(ii)] For multiple author papers please note the use of \verb"\affilnum" to
link names and affiliations. The corresponding author details need to be included using the
\verb+\corrauth+ command.

\item[(iii)] For submitting a double-spaced manuscript, add
\verb"doublespace" as an option to the documentclass line.

\item[(iv)] The abstract should be capable of standing by itself,
in the absence of the body of the article and of the bibliography.
Therefore, it must not contain any reference citations.

%\item[(v)] Keywords are separated by commas.

\item[(vi)] If you are submitting to a \textit{SAGE} journal that requires numbered sections (for example, IJRR), please add the command
  \verb+\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}+ just above the \verb+\begin{document}+ line.

\end{enumerate}


\section{The Body of the Article}

\subsection{Mathematics} \textsf{\journalclass} makes the full
functionality of \AmS\/\TeX\ available. We encourage the use of
the \verb"align", \verb"gather" and \verb"multline" environments
for displayed mathematics. \textsf{amsthm} is used for setting
theorem-like and proof environments. The usual \verb"\newtheorem"
command needs to be used to set up the environments for your
particular document.

\subsection{Figures and Tables} \textsf{\journalclass} includes the
\textsf{graphicx} package for handling figures.

Figures are called in as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{<figure name>}
\caption{<Figure caption>}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

For further details on how to size figures, etc., with the
\textsf{graphicx} package see, for example, \cite{R1}
or \cite{R3}.

The standard coding for a table is shown in Figure~\ref{F2}.

\begin{figure}
\setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}%
\setlength{\fboxrule}{0pt}%
\begin{center}
\begin{boxedverbatim}
\begin{table}
\small\sf\centering
\caption{<Table caption>}
\begin{tabular}{<table alignment>}
\toprule
<column headings>\\
\midrule
<table entries
(separated by & as usual)>\\
<table entries>\\
.
.
.\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{boxedverbatim}
\end{center}
\caption{Example table layout.\label{F2}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cross-referencing}
The use of the \LaTeX\ cross-reference system
for figures, tables, equations, etc., is encouraged
(using \verb"\ref{<name>}" and \verb"\label{<name>}").

\subsection{End of Paper Special Sections}
