# Set up

All of the heavy lifting is accomplished with makefile commands. See other documents in this directory for additional instructions

## Create a local environment 

**The conda environment contains _all_ necessary dependencies**

1. clone this repository
2. run `make environment` to build the conda environment with necessary dependencies
   - run `conda activate getis_empcenter` each time you work on the project
   - run `make environment-update` to rebuild the conda environment if you add new dependencies or they change upstream

## Use

Makefile commands do all the heavy lifting.  
Use `make` in the root of this directory to see all the available commands.

### General workflow

- edit `draft.md` and `references.bib` as necessary
- use `make notebooks` to execute the analysis
- use `make paper` to build the draft
- use `make submission` when ready to submit for publication

The manuscript is pre-configured for use with

- [pandoc-crossref](https://lierdakil.github.io/pandoc-crossref/) to refer to equations, figures, tables, etc without leaving markdown
- [pandoc-include](https://github.com/DCsunset/pandoc-include) for storing tables and/or sections of the draft in separate files
- [pandoc-latex-admonitions](https://github.com/chdemko/pandoc-latex-admonition) for adding notes or calling attention to sections for coauthors. Admonitions can also be helpful for responding to particular reviewer critiques
